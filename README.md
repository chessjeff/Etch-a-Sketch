# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a program that creates a grid with cells that listen for a mouse hover to create a drawing effect. It was written as part of The Odin Project foundations course. 

I learned how to delegate events to dynamically created elements, gained a better understanding of DOM manipulation, and practiced CSS.
